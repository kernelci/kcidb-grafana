KCIDB-Grafana
=============
KCIDB-Grafana is a collection of documentation/scripts/data files needed to
setup and maintain an instance of [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) displaying
Linux Kernel CI reports stored in a
[KCIDB](https://github.com/kernelci/kcidb/) database.

Architecture
------------

The current setup on [staging.kernelci.org](https://staging.kernelci.org:3000)
is implemented with a tweaked, but stock Grafana container, exposing port 3000
on localhost, and a Nginx configuration forwarding HTTPS connections on
outside port 3000 to it.

Grafana is configured with the following.

* BigQuery data source using a Google JWT file for authenticating to the KCIDB
  dataset with US as the processing location.
* A single organization called "Kernel CI".
* A number of dashboards displaying various objects in the database, with one
  of them ("Home") set as the home dashboard.
* Anonymous access enabled, and the "Kernel CI" organization appointed for it.

Setup
-----
To create and start a Grafana container run:

    docker-compose up -d

For development setup, remember to adjust or drop the GF_SERVER_DOMAIN
and GF_SERVER_HTTP_PORT environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`.

Login as an administrator (default credentials are `admin`/`admin`).

5. Upload Google Cloud Service Account key file. Grafana account will need
   "BigQuery Data Viewer" and "BigQuery Job User" roles only.

   data currently).
